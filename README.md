# ReversingLabs rl-secure Azure DevOps (ADO) Examples

This repository contains working examples of Azure DevOps (ADO) pipeline scripts to illustrate scanning with the
[ReversingLabs Spectra Assure CLI](https://docs.secure.software/cli/).

ReversingLabs Spectra Assure CLI is capable of scanning
[nearly any type](https://docs.secure.software/concepts/language-coverage)
of software artifact or package that results from a build.

In these examples, we're using the source code and Maven build instructions for the Struts2 showcase web app,
which came with [Apache Struts v2.5.28](https://archive.apache.org/dist/struts/2.5.28/).

The following examples are provided in this repository:

- **azure-pipelines.yml**
- **azure-pipelines-cli.yml**

Both examples require that you define the `RLSECURE_ENCODED_LICENSE` and the `RLSECURE_SITE_KEY` secret environment variables
to store your ReversingLabs
[license and site key](https://docs.secure.software/cli/deployment/rl-deploy-quick-start#prepare-the-license-and-site-key).

## Supported parameters

The following parameters can be modified in the pipeline.

**Note:** All optional string parameters have a default empty string value and do not have to be specified if not used.

| Parameter name | Required | Description | Type |
| :--------- | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `RLSECURE_ENCODED_LICENSE` | **Yes** | The `rl-secure` license file converted to a Base64-encoded string. Users must encode the contents of the license file, and provide the resulting string with this variable. | string |
| `RLSECURE_SITE_KEY` | **Yes** | The `rl-secure` license site key. The site key is a string generated by ReversingLabs and sent to users with the license file. | string |
| `RLSECURE_DIR` | **Yes** | The directory where `rl-secure` should be installed. The package store is automatically initialized in this directory. | string | 
| `ARTIFACT2SCAN` | **Yes** | The name of the file you want to scan. Must be relative to `BUILD_PATH`. The file must exist in the specified location before the scan starts. | string |
| `REPORT_PATH` | No | The directory where analysis reports will be stored after the scan is finished. The path must be relative to `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)`. The directory must be empty before the scan starts. | string |
| `PACKAGE_URL` | No | When using a package store, use this parameter to specify the package URL (PURL) for the scanned artifact. | string |


## azure-pipelines.yml

This pipeline script builds the WAR file and scans it using the
[ReversingLabs rl-scanner Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/reversinglabs/rl-scanner).

After the file is scanned, analysis reports in HTML, JSON, CycloneDX, and SPDX formats are saved as pipeline artifacts.


## azure-pipelines-cli.yml

This pipeline script builds the WAR file.

It installs the [rl-deploy](https://pypi.org/project/rl-deploy/) Python package,
which is subsequently used to install and license the `rl-secure` CLI.

After the file is scanned, analysis reports in HTML, JSON, CycloneDX, and SPDX formats are saved as pipeline artifacts.
